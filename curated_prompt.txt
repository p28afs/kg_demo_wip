Prompt:
"Please analyze the following financial regulatory reporting query and decompose it into multiple stand-alone subquestions. Each subquestion should cover a single aspect of the overall query. In your decomposition, make sure to address all applicable aspects, including:

Data Sourcing: Identify the sources of the data, the methods of data collection, and any data integration points.

Eligibility Rules: Specify the criteria for determining which data or transactions qualify for inclusion in the report.

Validations: Outline the checks, accuracy measures, and integrity validations required to ensure the data is correct and consistent.

Formatting: Describe the expected report structure or file format, including layout, message structure, or data format specifications.

Submission: Explain the protocols, channels, or systems used to submit the report, including any timing or procedural requirements.

Exceptions: Detail how exceptions or error conditions should be handled, including guidelines for managing missing or abnormal data.

Controls: Elaborate on the internal and external controls that need to be in place to monitor data quality and the reporting process.

Compliance: Specify the regulatory requirements, industry standards, or legal obligations that the report must meet, and how adherence is verified.

Additional Aspects: If applicable, consider areas such as data aggregation, reconciliation, audit trails, metadata requirements, or historical comparisons.

Important: Ensure that each subquestion includes or repeats the key entities or regulatory terms mentioned in the original query, so that the context is always preserved.

Example Query:
'What are details to be EMIR3 FCA transaction reported for PTRR ID, and its format and validations'
