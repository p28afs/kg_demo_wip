Overview:
We're enhancing a system that doesn't just provide answers—it learns from its mistakes. This project focuses on refining a Self-Improving Knowledge Assistant that uses user feedback to continuously evolve and deliver better responses over time.

Core Idea:
The assistant analyzes user feedback on past answers, understands the question context, and applies those insights to generate improved responses in the future. It's an assistant that learns how not to mess up the same way twice.

Key Features:

🧠 Feedback-Aware Learning: Learns from past mistakes by associating feedback with specific Q&A contexts.

🔁 Response Refinement Engine: Enhances future answers using past corrections and feedback loops.

📚 Persistent Knowledge Layer: Stores improvements and corrections in an evolving, retrievable format.

⚙️ Autonomous Self-Update: Continuously upgrades its answering logic without manual intervention.
